<p>My name is Zachary Vietor, I have been coding for nearly a half of a year.</p>

<p>I began learning languages as a hobby, but now I believe that I want to turn it into a career<p>
  <p> I'm currently on the fence about attending a coding camp, I'm really not sure that I need one, as I'm very self motivated and have a good learning ethic. My biggest concern is how much money it will cost.</p>
<lr> </lr>

<ul>
<h3>Languages have learned;</h3>
<li>Python</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Kotlin</li>
<li>HTML5</li>
<li>CSS</li>
</ul>
<p> If anyone has any questions for me, or would like to offer me advice, feel free to contact me via the e-mail address at the bottom of the page!</p>
